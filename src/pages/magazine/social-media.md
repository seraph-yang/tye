    Today I’d like to talk about how social media affects teen lives. Lately, my best friend got
social media as a present for her 13th birthday. More specifically, SnapChat and Instagram.
We’ve been friends for quite a while now, and have always been very social towards one
another, and enjoy talking instead of browsing the internet. But as soon as she got her first
phone a couple months ago, she has been on it more than ever. And it was just games. Now,
every day after school, almost every kid in the class pulls out their phone. Not a single word is
said. To me, it feels like a long friendship had been ruined. Everybody is living digitally and not
in the real world. It is hard to have a conversation without someone pulling out their phone. It is
sad to see all my friends slipping away. Social media cannot replace real-life relationships.

    At some levels, social media becomes an obsession and mental health issue. Some teens
who separated from their phones for even a few hours develop anxiety. They use the internet as a
safe haven for them. “Pediatricians observe that some teens suffer from “Facebook depression”.
After spending a lot of time on Facebook and other popular social networking sites, some teens
become anxious and moody. Again, this seems to be caused by being exposed to friends whose
idealized presentation of their lives appear to be superior to theirs.” (https://www.raisesmartkid.com)

    Living in a virtual world is not always sugar and sweets. Some teens just browse the internet
for fun, looking at new things to try out. But there is a whole other world out there: cyberbully, scam
and trick, and online predators, you name it. Many teens, especially girls, can feel insecure about
their body images from looking and comparing themselves to other girls. They can also be judged
brutally and unfairly by strangers on the internet. According to Forbes.com, “The CDC has been
tracking the rise in depression and suicidality among young people in recent years, and some
researchers strongly believe that social media is involved.” There can also be cyberbullying. Bullying
through the screen in a way hurts more than in real life. People who don’t even know you can start
spreading rumors. People who are too scared to say it face to face say it online easily through social
media.

    This generation of young adults is important. Do we really want social media affecting how
they think and act? I believe that as a solution to these problems, social media sites should enforce
their age limits. However, in this generation, kids are getting their smartphones too early. Even
though social media sites have minimum age limit at 13, many pre-teens, or even younger children
gain access to social media by forging their ages easily. I believe that there is no good side to
owning a smartphone before turning 13. There is just no need for it. In addition, schools should not
allow smartphones. If kids need to contact their parents, they can do so with a school phone. Also,
since parents are a major benefactor to their children’s development, they shouldn’t be on social
media too often. After all, eyes were made for the world, not for the screen.
