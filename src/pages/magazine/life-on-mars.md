Life on Mars

    This is my story. The story about me. The story about how I became the first person to ever set foot on Mars. Now let’s go back some years to see me in the hospital as a newborn. You could hear my mom screaming all the way from the doctor’s office to the hospital entrance. All I could see was a blur of colors. And all I could feel was confusion, discomfort, and fear. Everyone is the room was smiling, and the little kids were plugging their ears. The next thing I know I’m in a car in a baby carriage with my mom and dad and my siblings. Of course I started wailing again because I was hungry and tired.

    Years passed by until I was in fourth grade, it was time to get to school. I hopped into the car with a smile on my face. “What are you so excited about?” my dad asked while backing out of the driveway. “Our class is gonna share what we’re going to be when we grow up!” I said cheerfully. “Wow,” my dad said again, “fun!” A couple minutes later we pulled up at the school. I said goodbye to my dad, grabbed my backpack, tied my shoelaces, and ran to the school front gate. I opened the gate and closed it behind me. I could hear my best friends calling my name. I ran across the basketball court. Out of breath, I said “Hey guys.” “Hi!” they said together. Just then the bell rang, and my friends and I rushed over to our classroom door and waited in the line with all our class mages. About six seconds later, Mrs. Elliot came out of the door with a steaming hot coffee mug in her hands. “Good morning students,” she said in a calm voice, “come inside.” All the students walked slowly into the warm classroom and sat down at their desks. “I hope you guys know what you want to be when you grow up,” she said again. After our Bible lesson and our math lesson, we all sat down on the rug to talk about careers. My friend Aadya wanted to be a dancer. My friend Brooklyn wanted to be a professional soccer player. And my friend Rebbekah wanted to be a scientist. Finally it was my turn “Hmmm,” I said curiously. “You don’t have to know,” Mrs. Elliot said. “I’ll come up with it tomorrow,” I said.

    At dinner that night I was thinking about what my career should be. My family gave me some ideas. I thought about them and I said I didn’t think any of them were right for me. I couldn’t sleep that night. I was too worried about career day. The next morning I remembered something. We were having a field trip today! Luckily my parents already signed the permission slip. At school we got on the bus to go to the Museum of Natural History. When we arrived at the building Mrs. Elliot put us into groups. My group headed to the animal section. I looked over at another section behind us. I asked my group if we could take a look at it. So, we all headed over to the back section. “What does that say?” I asked my group. “Architecture,” replied my group. I speed read the words as my eyes were twinkling. That moment I knew I wanted to be an architect. My eyes veered off to the space section. As I read it my body was bursting with excitement. I told everyone I wanted to be an architect and an astronaut.

    Now, I bet you’re thinking if we can get to the Mars part… I’m just telling you the journey I took to get by jobs. And I will get to the point. As an architect and astronaut, I worked at NASA on the weekdays. But on the weekends I would study architecture. One day my boss was talking to one of my co-workers. I decided to see what it as about. My boss said they were talking about the new rover that was going to land on Mars. Then I asked if I could help. My boss told me, “If we need any help we’ll talk to you.” Months passed and I had not helped anyone. On the weekend I was doing research on furniture. When I accidentally swiped out of the app, I was the Gmail app. There was a letter to me. I read it. This is what it said. “In fine days we will invade your planet and take it.”

    It was the stealers, an evil tribe of griffins. As soon as I could I told my boss about the Stealers. At first he didn’t believe me but eight seconds later he got the same letter I did. Then we spoke to the President and he told the other presidents to fly everyone to outer space. But the plan needed someone to test out the ships NASA had built, and see if Mars was safe. I thought about it until I told NASA I would volunteer. The final day had arrived; I was nervous. After all, I was only thirty-two. I got into the ship, took a deep breath and pressed the start button. The countdown had started! Then I shot up into the air, I was flying in space! A little bit later I landed. I was excited and nervous at the same time. I thought there would be life on Mars. And it would be hotter than Earth. In my leather purse, I brought an iPad, walkie talkie, and of course a phone so I could call NASA. When I called them, they asked me what Mars was like. I told them I hadn’t got on Mars yet, I was still in the spaceship.

    It was the moment of truth. I stepped out of the space ship. And I was alive. I told NASA I was safe! Everyone was cheering. NASA said that everyone from planet Earth was getting ready to land on Mars. After walking a few miles I stopped to rest. I sat on a small red rock. Then I heard voices from behind a big rock. “Hello?” I said, scared. “Wabby Wommo?” said the voice again. A stuffed animal pig came out from the big rock. “Hello!” it said. “Ahh!” I screamed. It told me not to be afraid and that they were called the Wigs. It said that its name was Wiggy, and that it was a girl. I told Wiggy I came from Earth. Wiggy asked me why we did not go to the Moon. I told her the moon was also being attached.

  <p class="paragraph">
    We bonded some more until all of the people from planet Earth came. I introduced Wiggy and the Wigs to all the people from planet Earth. The wigs helped everyone find caves to live in and how to get food and water while Wiggy and I were getting started on building houses, I was an architect after all. But the thing about houses on Mars is that they are smaller. So it was a little bit easier. Everyone lived happily ever after on Mars. And Wiggy and I became best friends. I thought that maybe, just maybe, I liked Mars more that Earth.
